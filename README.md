# Restaurant-tips-analysis
This project explores the Restaurant Tips dataset from the Seaborn library to uncover insights into customer tipping behavior. The analysis focuses on understanding how various factors—such as total bill, gender, smoking habits, day, time, and group size influence the amount of tip given by customers.

Objectives:

-Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify key patterns and trends.

-Visualize relationships between numerical and categorical variables.

-Derive insights to understand what affects tipping behavior the most.

The dataset used in this project is the built-in tips dataset from Seaborn.


Column Name    |  	Description

total_bill	  -    Total bill amount (USD)

tip	          -   Tip amount given by the customer (USD)

Key Steps:

-Data Loading & Cleaning: Imported the dataset and handled missing values.

-Descriptive Statistics: Summarized key metrics of tips and total bills.

-Data Visualization: Used Matplotlib and Seaborn for visual insights.Plotted correlations, distributions, and comparisons.

-Insights Extraction: Interpreted visual trends to understand customer behavior patterns.

Insights Gained:

-Tips tend to increase with higher total bills.

-Male customers slightly tip more on average.

-Weekend dinners see higher bills and tips.

-Smokers vs. non-smokers show slight differences in tipping patterns.

Results:

The visual analysis provides a clear understanding of the key factors affecting tips. These insights can help restaurant managers and staff better understand customer patterns and plan promotions, services, or staffing accordingly.

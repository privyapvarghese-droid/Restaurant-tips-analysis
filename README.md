# Restaurant-tips-analysis
This project explores the Restaurant Tips dataset from the Seaborn library to uncover insights into customer tipping behavior. The analysis focuses on understanding how various factors—such as total bill, gender, smoking habits, day, time, and group size influence the amount of tip given by customers.
